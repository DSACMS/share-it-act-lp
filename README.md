# SHARE IT Act Landing Page

Guide to the SHARE IT Act helping federal agencies comply with software code sharing requirements.

## About the Project

The SHARE IT Act Landing Page provides documentation, tools, and guidance to help federal agencies comply with the legislation. It requires federal agencies to share custom developed software code, including metadata about the project, with each other to eliminate duplicative government work. Our project offers a suite of tools for generating, validating, and maintaining code.json files as well as guidance to get started.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a compliance path for all federal agencies to meet SHARE IT Act requirements while fostering an Open Source culture across government.

## Project Mission

To provide accessible, user-friendly tools and clear documentation that simplifies the process of implementing SHARE IT Act requirements.

## Agency Mission

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is committed to strengthening and modernizing the nation's health care system to provide access to high-quality care and improved health at lower costs.

## Team Mission

The CMS Open Source Program Office aims to facilitate the development, use, and sharing of open source software across government.

## Core Team

An up-to-date list of core team members can be found in [COMMUNITY.md](COMMUNITY.md). At this time, the project is still building the core team and defining roles and responsibilities. We are eagerly seeking individuals who would like to join the community and help us define and fill these roles.
