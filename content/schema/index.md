`code.json` is a metadata standard created to collect information on the agency's software projects. This is composed of:

- federal code.json standard, created as part of [M-16-21](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf)
- required metadata outlined in the [SHARE IT ACT](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/9566/text/ih) (e.g. repository visibility, contract number)
- [publiccode.yml](https://yml.publiccode.tools/) metadata, an international metadata standard

By harmonizing various standards, this opens up the opportunity to share our work not just on an agency level but also on a national and international level.

The generic code.json schema can be found in the [gov-codejson repository](https://github.com/DSACMS/gov-codejson/blob/main/schemas/schema-2.0.0.json).

### Extending the schema for agency use

The generic schema is designed to be extensible, allowing agencies to add metadata fields that are relevant to their specific needs.

For example, CMS has their [own schema](https://github.com/DSACMS/gov-codejson/tree/main/schemas/cms) that includes new fields such as FISMA level, subset in healthcare, and systems.

We encourage agencies to contribute by [submitting an agency schema addition issue](https://github.com/DSACMS/gov-codejson/issues) to [include their extended schema in the repository](https://github.com/DSACMS/gov-codejson/tree/main/schemas). This helps foster collaboration and ensures shared improvements benefit the wider community.

### Adding new metadata fields

For CMS, we are open to adding more fields to CMS code.json for any metadata the agency sees value in collecting. Request new metadata fields by filing a metadata field addition issue [here](https://github.com/DSACMS/gov-codejson/issues/new?template=metadata-field-addition.md).
